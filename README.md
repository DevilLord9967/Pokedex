# Pokedex Using C++

Open the pokedex.cbp using codeblocks 

Run the pokedex.cpp
**DO NOT BUILD IT**

Extract the pngs.zip in the master directory and replace the existing pngs. Extract the SDL.zip in the same place

I have added info of only 10 pokemons though it displays list of all six generation(721 pokemons)
You can add all pokemons if you like.
